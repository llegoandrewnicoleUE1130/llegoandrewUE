            I am Andrew Nicole D. Llego, born on November 30, 2001 in Metro Manila and 
grew up as the youngest with four older brothers. A single mother Genela Llego, and a 
grandmother Zenadia Dajon was the people who worked hard to raise us. My brothers 
from eldest to youngest, are Arvin, Arnold, Angelo and Audrey. As for my father, he left 
us when I was still a baby and has never made contact ever since. Despite this, my family 
that is with me got along well. While I myself do not have a very clear memory of my 
younger years; I was described as a very energetic child. Always running around and has 
a far too active of an imagination and curious about the things around me. Even when I 
was as young as 5 years old, I was exposed to a lot of English media and that has led to 
me being quite fluent with the language even then. Even my older brothers were the 
same in being fluent at the early age. My mother believed that having this skill would be 
of great use for us in the future and for the most part, I agree. Eventually I managed to 
get into the public elementary school Center of Excellence (CENTEX). CENTEX while a 
public elementary school is part of a program that is backed by Ayala Foundation. In that 
school, I was not one would call an exceptional student. Most of my grades would be 
called middling and I would take most of the blame there. I was more concerned with 
having fun rather than focus on my studies. Most of those around me has described me 
during my childhood as someone bright but does not apply themselves and now I am 
more grown up I agree. Outside of school, despite some financial difficulties, my mother 
would take me and my brothers to other places as family bonding trips. Sometimes its 
local like Luneta Park and other times we go to our cousins in the province of Zambales 
and Kamarin. Those memories of swimming in the beaches with my brothers and running 
around high up the hill are my most cherished childhood memories. So, all in all, while 
my academic side is not something exceptional, I believe I had a very good childhood. 

            For my high school years, initially the plan was I enter into a private high school but some 
problems arise. Three of my eldest brothers are going thru college so it goes without 
saying that the financial burden that placed on my single mother was immense. Combine 
that with my lackluster grades in my elementary school years where I could not secure a 
scholarship then the decision to enter a public high school was obvious, at least from my 
perspective. It was then in high school is when I decided to really apply myself 
academically. Focus more on the studying so that I can get decent grades so that I could 
start establishing a better career in the future. At the start, there were some adjustments 
that needed to be done since I was going from an Ayala backed school into a Public High 
School. There were a lot more people, it was a lot noisier, and the school schedule was 
less stream lined that I was used to. Despite those minor problems, I enjoyed it quite a 
lot. Even though I doubted people around me at the time when they said I had a good 
mind, I just didn’t apply it, seeing the progress I made academically in high school when 
I decided to focus was an eye opener. In the first year my grades shot up from an average 
of 85 in elementary to consistent 90s and up. In the first Year I was in Section 3 and by 
the time I was in Second year I jumped up to Section 1. In Second Year, is also when I 
met friends that would stick by me all throughout junior high. It was a confidence boost 
to me and being praised for it made me want to try harder. I was riding this high point 
all the way to third year of junior high and it felt as though everything is going to be all 
right. Unfortunately, it is in fourth year that my grandmother started showing obvious 
signs of Alzheimer's. It started out small like forgetting where she placed things and what 
date it was. We thought it was just her a part of her getting old so it wasn’t something 
we needed to get alarmed by. As I enter fourth year, I had a clear goal in mind for what 
I wanted to be when I get into college; I wanted to be an accountant like my mother. I 
applied for Senior High in the University of The East and got in the ABM program. My 
academics was still on the good side and with two of my brothers graduating in college, 
our financial burdens were becoming lighter. Things were going to plan but unfortunately, 
a global pandemic decided to throw things into chaos. 

  I graduated Senior High with honors and go into the college i wanted; University of Santo 
Thomas. I had to attend most of my classes online at home due to the pandemic that 
was spreading across the globe. This new online environment didn’t quite sit well with 
me and adjusting for it was a lot more difficult than expected. My grades took a small dip 
down but I thought it's still manageable but things were about to get worse. My 
grandmothers Alzheimer's’ started getting worse and with me being at home with her, I 
had to pull double duty of being a care taker and doing online school. Our finance may 
have gotten better but that doesn’t mean all the debts my mother incurred to put my 
brothers thru college was wiped away as well so we couldn’t hire a 24/7 caretaker so I 
had to make do. This took a lot out of my mental health with worrying over my 
grandmother, adjusting to a new online platform, and the global pandemic made me 
unable to properly focus on my studies. When Second Year College came around and 
saw my grades, I knew I couldn’t continue on my dream of becoming an accountant. I 
decided to take a year off college and focus on taking care of my grandmother so that 
she can at least have a comfortable end. It wasn’t always pleasant since she often forgot 
where she was, who I was, and she had an obsession with money that wasn’t there 
anymore. There were times when care for her got extremely difficult when she refused 
to sleep, got irrationally mad and hallucinate things that didn’t happen or wont drink her 
medicines but I pushed thru with my family. My eldest brother started earning quite a lot 
of money and so during those last years of my grandmother, we went on trips once more. 
We went to the beach, the province and all sorts of places so that she wouldn't be cooped 
up at home doing nothing but forget and my grandmother even managed to attend my 
Eldest Brothers wedding. I like to think she was happy in those final years. My 
grandmother finally died on April 4, 2023. After her death I took a hard look into my life 
and decided to change course. With my interest in working with computers rising during 
the pandemic years, I applied for BSIT at the suggestion of my brothers and mother and 
went back into the familiar University of the East. At the low point of my life, most of my 
confidence i had built up during my high school years really took a toll but after just one 
year into Programming, I find that I quite like it a lot. My grades started going back up 
and I feel like I’m enjoying the lessons more than when I was in accounting. And now at 
the time of writing this I truly feel like I am on the right track once more. </pre>
